What a nice day! Brooklyn Nets beated Chicago tonight! It is the first time that Nets had taken down a strong team since this season, and a big win. Can i enjoy another moment better than this? Uh---no! Love KD.

But the saddest thing is I lost my "7 - Bounty Hunter" game... I just blame on the network paralysis.

BTW my fps cut down since I upgrade the latest intel graphics driver. What the hell are u doing? I try traced back to the last version, but nothing works. Alright---- All I can do is wait for the next version, like I did about my Arch Linux before, which I waited for ten days but failed eventually.

A good day. Good night...
